# [Uniwav](http://uniwav.eu/) - Technical part

This is the *Horloge*'s part with *Arduino* â†’ *Raspberry* communication, and the data writing system.

On *C / C++* side, components used in the system are running with these libraries:

On the *Python* script, we use the `Serial` library, available [here](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyserial).
